# Dr. Regex: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Regular Expressions

A Regex (regular expression) is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. Generally, these patterns are used by algorithms that use a string-searching method for "find" or "find and replace" operations on strings, as well as searching for input validation.

## Summary

In this tutorial, we will be explaining the components of a regular expression, and how it works to create patterns for matching text. We will cover anchors, quantifiers, grouping contructs, bracket expressions, character classes, OR operator, flags, and character escapes.

## Regex Components

### Anchors

Anchors are used to specify the position of a pattern within the text being matched. The two most common anchors used in regular expressions are `^` (the Caret symbol) and `$` (the Dollar sign). The Caret symbol is used to match the beginning of a line, and the Dollar sign is used to match the end of a line.

### Quantifiers

Quantifies specify how many time a preceding element should occur in the text being matched. There are many quantifiers that you can use:

- `*` The asterisk is used to match zero or more occurrences of the preceding element
- `+` The plus sign is used to match one of more occurrences of the preceding element
- `?` The question mark is used to match zero or one occurrences of the preceding element
- `{n}` Curly braces are used to specify an exact number of the occurrences of the preceding element
- `{n,}` Curly braces with a comma are used to specify a minumum number of occurrences of a preceding element
- `{n,m}` Curly braces with a comma between two values is used to specify a range of occurrences of a preceding element
